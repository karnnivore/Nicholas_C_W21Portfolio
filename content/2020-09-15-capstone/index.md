### [Project Summary](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_LyZK6XgVCVHvhX7FBPCYWWa4AHM1odj/view?usp=sharing)

Storm Chaser tracks storms within Canada and retrieves residential information on homes affected by different storms nation-wide. To correlate information on storms and natural disasters to produce actionable results for the roofing business by generating leads. By tracking storms and using the correlated information gained from the application, it would be used to generate leads for the roofing company we are initially creating it for, in order for them to utilize the leads for sales opportunities. For example, using the information to generate a lead to sell them information on homes affected by storms, for them to sell their services to those affected. By using external entities like data sensors (to utilize maps and weather forecasts, and Client Management Systems to organize and update leads.



### [Project Vision](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R2tvxNJPw4EOjSoo6TTEk_FYf8e-CMdDg9X41RTdVd8/edit?usp=sharing)

After we created the inital project summary our group created the project vision which contained an introduction of our project, it's purpose, scope and analysis of various components of the system we would need.

### [Project/Business Requirements](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fHPBmOWTYpd7NTiAuFhfiFTxI_0Hg7xE/view?usp=sharing)

Another key component of the project was the planning of the project/business requirements that would be needed in the system to ensure our success.

### [Project Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aAEmZ6Tb7YUmzDdAWHS5KbQ4QWEEsW3NsTOHOJh4-f4/edit?usp=sharing)

After we created the list of project requirements we created a project plan which consisted of the scope of the project, deliverables, dependencies and risk management that would have to be taken into account. We also created important milestones for the project and task listings

### Requirements Analysis and Design

An important part of the project was gathering the requirements for our system and the necessary things that we would need to be able to implement our capstone. This process was completed throughout the semesters and we added requirements throughout the process as we researched what our project would need to be successful.

### [Wireframes & Mockups](https://www.figma.com/file/3q1CgxzNTsjujEBuMpMauD/Project-Storm-Chaser?node-id=0%3A1)

We created wireframes & mockups for the projected web application using Figma which allowed us to collaborate on the wireframes together and come up with a design we liked that would fit in all of the required functionalities.

### Status Reports

Throughout the project we created multiple status reports that recorded our progress on the project. Some things that it included were accomplishments that we planned and completed, things that we planned but had not finished. It also included planned task for the next sprint and milestones that we would want to achieve. Additionally it contained information regarding issues & risks that we were facing while creating the project.

### [System Implementation](https://github.com/karnnivore/storm-chaser)

We implemented our project using Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node which allowed us to experiment with a modern stack that is widely used throughout the industry. It's a great learning experience and we're constantly improving and updating the project.
