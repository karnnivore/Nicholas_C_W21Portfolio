# [My Portfolio Site](https://github.com/karnnivore/nick-chinsen)
My updated portfolio site, upgraded from a basic WordPress setup. Integrated using Travis CI and hosted on an AWS Cloudfront server, using S3 for storage. I initially created this project in between Fall and Winter semester 2020, and it's always getting updated.

### ReactJs & Gatsby
I decided to use React and Gatsby for my application as I used React a bunch in my last semester. I also wanted to use Gatsby, after seeing it in action on a variety of websites, my favourite being [Wealth Simple](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/). The speed of Gatsby and ability to deploy, quick applications anywhere was very appealing to me, so I taught myself the basics and this site is the result.
