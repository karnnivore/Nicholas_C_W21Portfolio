### Remote education platform for under-represented youths around the GTA.

This project was started in August after I got into contact with the Creative Director at Crue TV. He had a new project which was partnered with the Red Cross, to build a Remote Learning Platform which would stream the entire Adobe Creative Suite to users. After some back and forth I started on the project as the lead Web Designer & Developer. Some technologies used were, Figma, AWS services, Adobe Creative Cloud, WordPress, and Moodle.

### Step 1: Wireframing & Design

Initially I designed my wireframes using Figma. I incorporated various components from successful education platforms, modifying them to match our look. I had meetings with the stakeholders a few times a week where I would show them the design getting the necessary feedback and making changes from there.

### Step 2: System Planning

Another key component of the project was the planning of the various systems that we would be using. This process took a couple weeks and we used estimates of our expected student load, basing our system design on that.

### Step 3: Implementation

After the Design & System Planning phase I proceeded with implenting the landing pages initially using WordPress and hosting them on EC2 servers. Afterwards, I created the Education platform using Moodle with Stripe integration for payments. Finally the Creative Cloud remote access platform was created using AWS AppStream so we could stream the entire suite of products directly to our students.

### Step 4: Testing

The websites were continuously tested throughout the process, however we also spent 2 weeks testing everything in the system, ensuring that it was production ready for our students & teachers.

### Step 5: Deployment

We deployed the education service November 15, 2020 and have since served over 200 students successfully.

### Step 6: Maintenance

I'm still part of the project, completing routine maintenance for the platform, ensuring that the service continues to run smoothly.

Overall I had a great time with this project and I'm proud that I was able to deliver a polished product to over 200 students in partnership with the Red Cross and Crue TV.
