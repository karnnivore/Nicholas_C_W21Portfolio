[Wealthsimple Culture Project](https://github.com/karnnivore/Culture-project) 
Wealthsimple is a company I love and have immense respect for and their mission to empower everyone & anyone to achieve financial freedom, is something really want to be a part of one day.

## Created with Gatsby, and ReactJS
I decided to make a webpage with some of my values and make it in the style of Wealthsimples culture page, as their core values really resonate with my own.
